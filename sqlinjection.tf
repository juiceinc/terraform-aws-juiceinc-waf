# SQL Injection is a built-in type of traffic that the WAF knows how to filter.  To my knowledge we are left to the mercy
# of their heuristics on the backend to correctly classify elements as containing malicious SQL.  We just specify which
# fields to match on and any transformations to do.

# As of this writing valid values for field_to_match are: HEADER (if using this also must set a data value), METHOD,
# QUERY_STRING, URI, BODY, SINGLE_QUERY_ARG, ALL_QUERY_ARGS.

# Valid values for text_transformation include: CMD_LINE, COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE, HTML_ENTITY_DECODE, LOWERCASE, NONE, and
# URL_DECODE

# The following rule set was transcribed from the AWS example in their CloudFormation template.
